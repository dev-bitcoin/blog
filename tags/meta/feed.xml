&lt;p>The bitcoin-dev.blog was an experiment. The goal was to find out if an
open-content blog is something Bitcoin developers would use to share their
projects and ideas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The idea was born during a time when fewer in-person meetings were possible.
It was harder to keep up-to-date on what projects other Bitcoin Developers were
working on. It was unclear if developers would put in the time to write about
their work, especially on a blog they don&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;own&amp;rdquo;. There&amp;rsquo;s no point in chasing
people to write blog posts about their projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few things have changed. Primarily, in-person meetings at meetups, conferences,
and developer meetings are possible again. Additionally, some project discussion
has moved to &lt;a href="https://delvingbitcoin.org">delvingbitcoin.org&lt;/a>, which has a better
posting, editing, and commenting user experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the beginning on, it was clear to me that this experiment would end, when
I lose the motivation to pay the 23 EUR/year domain. This has happened. I have
plenty of other projects to work on. Currently, I think these are more important
than this blog. I won&amp;rsquo;t renew the domain registration, which will run out in
November 2024.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consider this blog, along with its domain, open for adoption.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to Elle Mouton and Kalle Rosenbaum who put in the work of cross posting
their blog posts here.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
