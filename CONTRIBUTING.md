# Contributing to the bitcoin-dev blog

1. Find a technical Bitcoin topic you want to write about
  - This can, for example, be about a Bitcoin open-source project you work on, or a technical topic you've recently dove into.
  - If you are not sure if the topic of your post is suitable for this blog, you can get feedback by opening a [topic-review issue].
2. Write the post (or crosspost it from your own blog!)
  - The contents of a post lives under `content/blog/<blog-post-title>.md`.
  - These files contain a few lines of YAML front matter with, for example, the title and author information.
    - If you have [`hugo`] installed on your system, you can use `hugo new blog/blog-post-title.md` to create a new markdown file from a [template].
    - If you don't have [`hugo`] installed on your system, you can copy an existing blog post, delete the content, and edit the front matter.
  - There is an example blog post showing how to format text and how to embed code, images, and videos. The post is not listed, but can be found [here][example-post] and the [source here][example-source].
3. We strive for high-quality blog posts.
  - The post doesn't have to be perfect but should contain very few formatting, spelling, grammar, or technical mistakes. Try asking other people to review your content first.
  - Your post should arouse interest in the project or topic.
  - We recommended to self-advertise. Include links to your project for interested developers to learn more and to reach out.
  - Keep your blog post roughly between two and six pages. Feel free to split a post up into multiple, independent parts.
4. We follow a few strict rules.
  - Price-talk, altcoins, and politics are off-topic. This is a technical, bitcoin-only blog.
  - Posts you submit should be your original content. You must own the copyright or have permission from the owner to use the material.
  - Posts (text and images) are published under an [Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)] license once merged.
  - Cross-posting from your blog is welcome. Feel free to link to the site where the post first appeared.
5. Open a PR to the [dev-bitcoin/blog repo] and wait for review.
