The bitcoin-dev blog is a technical, open-content blog covering topics and projects Bitcoin developers work on.

These blog posts are for new contributors exploring the breadth of existing topics and projects,
for seasoned developers wanting to get short updates,
for our pseudonymous and anonymous friends who can't or don't want to attend CoreDev, BitDevs, other meetups, and conferences,
for lurkers, and the loud Bitcoin-Twitter voices.
Posts are written by new Bitcoin developers diving deep into a topic,
by designers making the technical side of Bitcoin more accessible, by students,
and by long-time Bitcoin Core contributors implementing complex new features.
**Everyone can submit a PR for a blog post covering a technical Bitcoin topic or an open-source Bitcoin project.**
