Here is the description of the example blog post.
You'd want to summarize the contents of the following post.
Don't let this get too long, though!

Here the blog post starts.
You can find the [source] on GitHub.
Please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md] before you start writing a post for this blog.

[CONTRIBUTING.md]: https://github.com/dev-bitcoin/blog/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

#### Text

You can use markdown formatting.

- **Bold text.**
- _Italic text._
- *More italic text.*
- ~~Strikethrough text.~~


#### Links

Markdown lets us include links in three formats.
[Inline-style links](https://your-looooong-url.btc) can often get very long and make reading the markdown source harder.
[Reference-style links] are shorter and thus preferred.

#### Images

For images, we could use markdown image tags too.
However, it's recommended to use the custom `center-figure` [Hugo shortcode].
This is based on the built-in [`figure`] shortcode but automatically centers the image and captions.

[Hugo shortcode]: https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/
[`figure`]: https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#figure

```
{{</* center-figure src="/img/logo-512.png" caption="The bitcoin-dev.blog logo." height=128 width=128 */>}}
```
produces

{{< center-figure src="/img/logo-512.png" caption="The bitcoin-dev.blog logo." height=128 width=128 >}}

Generally, including images in the repository is preferred to linking to external images.
Check if you have permission to include the image.

#### Code

The built-in shortcode [`highlight`] can be used to showcase code.

```
{{</* highlight rust */>}}
  let mut builder = wallet_bob.build_tx();
  builder
    .add_recipient(addr.script_pubkey(), 60_000)
    .add_foreign_utxo(alice_outpoint, alice_psbt_input, satisfaction_weight)?;
{{</* /highlight */>}}
```

produces


{{< highlight rust >}}
  let mut builder = wallet_bob.build_tx();
  builder
    .add_recipient(addr.script_pubkey(), 60_000)
    .add_foreign_utxo(alice_outpoint, alice_psbt_input, satisfaction_weight)?;
{{< /highlight >}}

#### Footnotes

We can include footnotes[^this-is-a-footnote-ref] by using `[^ref]` where `ref` is reference to a `[^ref]: <footnote-text>`.

[^this-is-a-footnote-ref]: This is a footnote.


#### Tweets

Hugo offers a built-in tweet shortcode too.

```
{{</* tweet 1110302988 */>}}
```

{{< tweet 1110302988 >}}


#### Videos

Vimeo and YouTube videos can be embedded with the [`vimeo`] and [`youtube`] tags.

[`vimeo`]: https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#vimeo

[`youtube`]: https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#youtube

`{{</* vimeo 412058509 */>}}` produces
{{< vimeo 412058509 >}}


`{{</* youtube Ey0xAcN11zk */>}}`
produces


{{< youtube Ey0xAcN11zk >}}

#### $\LaTeX$ via MathJax

$\LaTeX$ formulars can be embeeded with [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/).
MathJax is disabled by default, but can be enabled by setting `mathjax: true` in the front-matter.
See the front-matter of this post for an example.

In-line LaTeX can be written as $1 + 1 = 3$. This also works in headings.
Due to Hugo's MarkDown parser, multi-line formulars [need six backslashes](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes/issues/291#issuecomment-334746889) (`\\\\\\\\\\\\`) between new lines.
See the example below.

$$
\begin{align}
p & : \text{private key}  \\\\\\
P = pG & : \text{public key}  \\\\\\
m & : \text{message}  \\\\\\
r & : \text{random nonce}  \\\\\\
R = rG & : \text{nonce commitment}
\end{align}
$$
