This post introduces the _Bitcoin Engineer_ role and its requirements and
responsibilities for bridging between a company and the Bitcoin ecosystem.


<!--more-->

A _Bitcoin Engineer_ is the connection between a company and the Bitcoin
ecosystem. You probably haven't seen many roles called _Bitcoin Engineer_ on
job postings by Bitcoin companies. Sometimes these roles hide under the generic
_Backend Engineer_ or _Software Engineer_ positions. In these positions, you'll
probably only spend a part of your time as _Bitcoin Engineers_. However, there
are also full-time _Bitcoin Engineer_ positions out there.


A Bitcoin Engineer should bring a deep understanding of the Bitcoin protocol,
its history, and its development. Participation in, for example, the Chaincode
Labs [Bitcoin Protocol Development] seminar is excellent, though someone who
studied the Bitcoin protocol by himself is just as good. The engineer should be
interested in, for example, keeping up-to-date with the [Bitcoin Optech
Newsletter] and relevant technical discussions on the bitcoin-dev mailing list
and similar forums.

A basic understanding of open-source projects, especially Bitcoin Core and
other internally used software, is needed. Additionally, basic software
development and Linux skills are required. Working with Git, Python,
and Bash scripts shouldn't be a problem. More software development experience
is a plus. Good written and spoken English is essential to bridge the company
and the technical Bitcoin ecosystem. Another plus is being interested in
networking with other Bitcoin developers and engineers at technical conferences
and meetups.

You should help to educate your colleagues by, for example, giving internal
presentions on relevant topics. Another part of your job is supporting the
internal engineering team on how to best interface with the Bitcoin protocol.
Also, the company's interests should be communicated on, for example, the
mailing list. You should participate in discussions about standardizations and
protocol changes and review proposals such as BIPs. This can happen under a
pseudonym connected to the company to clarify that these are the company's
interests and not necessarily the engineer's. Often, however, it works best if
these two align.

Another responsibility of a Bitcoin Engineer is to test and review internally
used open-source Bitcoin software. This can include, for example, reviewing and
testing Bitcoin Core pull requests and release candidates. Keeping up-to-date
on changes to open-source projects ensures there aren't any surprises in new
releases, and giving developers feedback helps them learn how users use their
software and prioritize what to work on.

The engineer should also attend technical conferences and meetups to network,
learn, and possibly speak about their work for the company. The company should
support the engineer by paying for traveling, conference tickets, and possible
networking costs.
