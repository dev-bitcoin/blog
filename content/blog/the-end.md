The bitcoin-dev.blog will be discontinued later this year.

The bitcoin-dev.blog was an experiment. The goal was to find out if an
open-content blog is something Bitcoin developers would use to share their
projects and ideas.

The idea was born during a time when fewer in-person meetings were possible.
It was harder to keep up-to-date on what projects other Bitcoin Developers were
working on. It was unclear if developers would put in the time to write about
their work, especially on a blog they don't "own". There's no point in chasing
people to write blog posts about their projects.

A few things have changed. Primarily, in-person meetings at meetups, conferences,
and developer meetings are possible again. Additionally, some project discussion
has moved to [delvingbitcoin.org](https://delvingbitcoin.org), which has a better
posting, editing, and commenting user experience.

From the beginning on, it was clear to me that this experiment would end, when
I lose the motivation to pay the 23 EUR/year domain. This has happened. I have
plenty of other projects to work on. Currently, I think these are more important
than this blog. I won't renew the domain registration, which will run out in
November 2024.

Consider this blog, along with its domain, open for adoption.

Thanks to Elle Mouton and Kalle Rosenbaum who put in the work of cross posting
their blog posts here.
